# Video

How `short-form-video` makes the actual video: with a connected
image/video tool, or rendered on your machine for free. The renderer is
the main path: templates for marketing and everyday posts, narrated
videos with captions synced to the voice (`compose.js`), your own
filmed takes (`cut.js`), and the brand's look and sound on every one.

## Connecting a visual-generation tool

`visual-brief-generator` checks your currently connected tools for an
image/video-generation MCP connector at runtime — it doesn't assume a
specific one. Higgsfield launched an official hosted MCP server in 2026
(Runway and Midjourney still have no known official one as of this
writing); a **Canva** connector also exists (requires connecting via
OAuth in your Claude settings) as another real option for visual asset
work — neither is hardcoded or assumed present. If none is connected, the
skill still produces the full written brief and prompts — just paste them
into whatever tool you use.

## Connecting a short-form video generation tool

`short-form-video` checks the same way, at runtime, for a connected
image/video-generation tool — it never assumes one is present, the same
rule `visual-brief-generator` follows above.

- **Higgsfield** is a real option if you have it connected: its hosted
  MCP server exposes 30+ image/video models (including Veo, Sora, Kling,
  and Seedance) through one connection, generating clips up to roughly 15
  seconds per generation from a text or image prompt. It isn't a default
  connector for every account, so if you have a Higgsfield account and
  want to use it here, add it yourself as a custom connector: in Claude,
  go to Customize → Connectors → Add custom connector, and give it a name
  plus Higgsfield's own MCP server URL from your Higgsfield account.
  Connecting the MCP server itself is free; **generating through it still
  spends Higgsfield's own credits** (published annual plans currently run
  from about $15/month for 200 credits up to $99/month for 3,000 — new
  accounts get some starter credits free). Being connected doesn't mean
  free generation, the same distinction this plugin's `email-outreach`
  skill already draws about a connected prospecting tool.
- **Figma Weave** is another option if you have the Figma connector: its
  `weave_*` tools can run named AI video models (Veo, for example). It
  spends your Weave credits — the skill shows you the quoted cost and
  waits for a yes before each run — and it only works once your Figma
  account is linked to Weave in Weave's own profile settings.
- **Canva** works here too, the same connector already documented above
  for `visual-brief-generator`.
- **Listed isn't the same as working.** A connector can appear in your
  session but still be waiting on authorization (Canva often is), or
  still need an account linked (Weave). The skill tells you which one and
  the exact fix, rather than just saying nothing is connected.
- **Once a clip is generated**, the skill downloads it to a local file
  right away, because generator links usually expire. That file is what
  `--platform youtube` uploads. For Instagram or TikTok, re-host it on a
  URL you control before posting: TikTok only fetches from a domain
  verified for your own app.
- **No connector at all?** The skill can still render the video itself
  on your machine, for free. See "Rendering a short-form video locally"
  below.
- **If none of these is connected**, the skill still produces the full script
  and per-platform package, and recommends current free tools to actually
  make the video yourself — **CapCut** is the most confident
  recommendation (genuinely free, no watermark on exports, built for
  vertical Shorts/Reels/TikTok-style editing specifically), with Canva's
  free tier as a second solid option. Plenty of other "free AI short-video
  generator" tools advertise themselves online; this plugin's research
  couldn't independently verify most of their actual quality or
  free-ness, so treat any of them beyond these two as something to vet
  yourself before trusting with real content.

## Rendering a short-form video locally

`scripts/video/render.js` turns an animated HTML page into a finished
vertical video, with no video-generation service involved. When you opt
in, `short-form-video` writes the page from its own script and renders
it. You can also run the renderer yourself.

**What it makes:** motion graphics (kinetic text, shapes, UI mockups) over
real backgrounds, with music composed for your project, and a voiceover if
you record one. It doesn't film your product or people, but it does finish
footage you film: `cut.js` takes a talking-head take from your phone, cuts
out the pauses, and makes the video from it with its own sound, captions,
your hook, music, and end card, and screen recordings play in the how-to
phone frame without being cropped. The output is 1080×1920
(9:16), 30fps H.264 with AAC audio mixed to about −14 LUFS, which is what
YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and TikTok all expect.

**One-time setup:** you need Node 18+, ffmpeg (`brew install ffmpeg` or
`apt install ffmpeg`), and Playwright:

```
cd scripts/video
npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # skip if Google Chrome is installed; it's used as a fallback
npm install kokoro-js             # optional: free generated voiceovers (about 600 MB)
```

For stock backgrounds, also get free API keys from
[Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/) and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)
and set them as `PEXELS_API_KEY` and `PIXABAY_API_KEY`. Without them, only
Openverse photos are available (no video clips).

**Usage:**

```
node render.js templates/promo.html out.mp4             # full render, in parallel: well under a minute for 24s
node render.js templates/promo.html out.mp4 --draft     # half size at 15fps, a few seconds, to check timing
node render.js --batch week/*.html --outdir renders     # a week of pages in one run, every hook variant included
node render.js templates/promo.html --check             # lint the layout over the whole timeline, in seconds
node render.js templates/promo.html --slides            # each scene's settled frame as a PNG (also a carousel)
node render.js templates/promo.html --stills 1.5,6,12   # preview frames at chosen times
node render.js templates/promo.html out.m4a --audio-only  # just the soundtrack, in seconds
node render.js --sample pop out.m4a --motif "1 3 5 3 | 6 5 3 -" --key D   # audition a sound
node render.js page.html out.mp4 --silent               # silent audio track instead of the soundtrack
node media.js search "cozy coffee shop morning" --out assets --count 3     # stock photos (+ --type video)
node media.js search "upbeat acoustic" --type music --out assets          # Creative Commons music, with tempo and credits
node check.js                                            # QA every template: layout, cues, fonts, loudness
node beats.js assets/track.mp3 --align 2 --duration 24   # a track's tempo and beats, started so its drop hits 2s
node voice.js script.md --out assets --voice af_heart     # a free voiceover, one WAV per script line
node voice.js --audition samples "One line to try."       # the same line in four voices, to pick one
node compose.js script.md                                 # a narrated video page from a script: voice, backgrounds, synced captions
node render.js page.html --voice-lengths                  # each voice line's start, length, and room in its scene
node captions.js assets/voice-1.wav --text "the line"     # when each word of a line is said
node brand.js page.html                                   # the Visual Identity: colors, font, a logo end card
node render.js page.html out.mp4 --variants a,b --cover 0 # one video per hook variant, plus the cover frame
node cut.js take.mp4 --text "what's said" --page page.html # a filmed talking-head take: pauses cut, captioned, ready to render
```

Every page's hook is on screen from the first frame, which is also the
default cover, and `--check` fails a page whose first frame has no text or
whose text leaves before it can be read. Hook variants (`data-variant`)
render several versions of one video to test, and `--cover` writes the
cover frame, checked against the 3:4 crop the profile grids show.
`brand.js` applies the Visual Identity saved in `brand-voice.md` (colors,
a display font, and an end card with the logo and handle that lands with
the sonic logo), the visual counterpart of the Sonic Identity.

Every render lints its layout as it goes: text outside the area the
platforms' buttons and captions leave clear, text spilling out of its box
or clipped, and text running into other text or a card all get reported
with the time they happen. That's what catches rewritten copy that runs
long. `check.js` runs the same lint over every template (or the pages you
name), checks every sound cue, the music settings, the fonts, and the
loudness, and writes a report with a contact sheet per page to look over.

Fonts (Inter, and TikTok Sans for everyday posts) and color emoji come from
Google Fonts. The renderer fetches and caches them itself, so after the
first run it works offline, and behind proxies the browser doesn't trust.

### Backgrounds

Every scene in a template has an empty background slot already timed to
it. Put a photo or clip in it and it fills the frame, with:
- a slow zoom or pan
- a crossfade to the next scene
- a scrim that keeps text readable (bright images get darkened
  automatically)
- one shared color grade, so mixed sources look like one set

`blur` softens a busy image, and `tint` washes it in your accent color.
An empty slot shows the gradient instead.

Where backgrounds come from:
- **Stock photos and video clips:** `scripts/video/media.js` searches
  Pexels, Pixabay, and Openverse for vertical media. It downloads into the
  page's `assets/` folder and writes `CREDITS.md`, with each file's license
  and the exact credit line to put in your caption when one is required
  (Pexels and CC BY photos need one). Openverse results are limited to
  licenses that allow commercial use and modification.
- **AI-generated images:** made with a connected image tool (Figma Weave
  once your Figma account is linked, or Higgsfield). The skill quotes the
  cost and waits for your yes before every image. If an AI image looks
  photorealistic, switch on the platform's AI-content label when posting;
  TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram all ask for it.

Stock and AI images set the scene only. They never stand in for your
customers, team, product, or results; those are always your own real
photos and screenshots.

### Sound

Every video gets music composed for it in your project's **sonic
identity**: one genre, tempo, key, energy, and signature hook. It's saved
in `references/brand-voice.md` and used for every video, so your sound
becomes recognizable the way a jingle does. There are eleven genres:
`pop`, `house`, `hiphop`, `acoustic`, `cinematic`, `tech`, `lofi`, `calm`,
and three for very online Gen Z and Gen Alpha feeds: `phonk`, `jersey`
(jersey club), and `funk` (Brazilian funk).
The first time you render, the skill proposes two identities that fit your
audience and plays you a short preview of each.
[`references/sound-guide.md`](../references/sound-guide.md) explains the
genres and how they map to audiences, and has a library of hooks.

How a video's soundtrack is put together:
- **The hook:** enters as the melody when the beat drops, answered by a
  variation every four bars. Chords are chosen to fit it.
- **The ending:** a **sonic logo**, the hook's first notes resolving
  home on the last beat.
- **Sound effects:** land on the moments the page marks (words popping
  in, list items, checkmarks, a button press, scene changes), in the
  music's key. Everyday posts also get the meme cues: a boom, a record
  scratch, an air horn, a rimshot, a sad trombone, a drumroll, a ding and
  a buzzer, message pings, typing, a camera shutter, a ka-ching, a glitch,
  and a sub drop.
- **No licensing:** it's all synthesized from scratch, so there's nothing
  to license, and it works when posting through an API, where in-app
  trending sounds can't be added.
- **Your own track instead:** add `data-music-src="assets/track.mp3"`.
  The renderer trims it, fades it, and dips it under the sound effects.
  `beats.js` finds the track's tempo, beats, bars, and its biggest lift
  (a drop or chorus), so the skill can start the track where the lift
  lands on your hook and cut scenes on the beat. It says how confident it
  is; on music without a steady beat, scenes follow the voice instead.
  `sound-guide.md` lists where to get licensed tracks; never use a
  popular song without a license.
- **Longer videos:** the generated music is written for shorts and
  repeats the same few bars, so for anything over about 45 seconds use
  your own track. The renderer warns when a long video doesn't.
- **A voiceover:** record each line of the script on your phone, put the
  files in `assets/`, and add `data-voice="assets/voice-1.m4a"` to the
  element each line belongs to (or `<body data-voice-src>` for one
  continuous take). The renderer trims the silence before each line,
  evens out their levels, and ducks the music and effects under your
  voice.
- **A free generated voice instead:** `voice.js` reads the script with
  Kokoro, an open-source voice model (Apache-2.0) that runs on your own
  machine, so there's no account, API key, or cost. It writes one WAV per
  line in any of 28 stock voices. Install it once with `npm install
  kokoro-js`; the first run downloads the model (about 90 MB) and then
  works offline. If a platform asks whether a video uses AI-generated
  audio, say yes.
- **Captions synced to the voice:** most people watch muted. A line in
  `<div class="say auto" data-voice="...">` is shown word by word in short
  chunks, the word being said highlighted, timed to the clip by
  `captions.js` with no service involved (about 50 ms from the true word
  starts on average, checked against synthesized speech). The render also
  writes an `.srt` caption file. `--whisper` uses Whisper's word timing
  instead, if `kokoro-js` is installed.
- **A narrated video in one step:** `compose.js` takes a script of numbered
  lines (each with an optional `[bg: search query]`), voices it or uses
  your takes, fetches a background per line, times every scene to its line
  with cuts on the beat, and writes the page with the hook on screen from
  the first frame.

### Templates by video type

`short-form-video` picks a type from
[`references/video-types.md`](../references/video-types.md), a catalog of 23
marketing video types with the beats for each, how it gets made, and what
background and sound suit it. It then starts from the matching template
in `scripts/video/templates/`:

| Template | Length | For | Default sound |
|---|---|---|---|
| `promo.html` | 24s | Ads, brand profile, explainer, educational lists (it's a promo for this plugin) | tech |
| `how-to.html` | 20s | Tutorials, and product demos told as steps on a phone screen | tech |
| `testimonial.html` | 20s | Customer testimonials, case studies with counted-up results, interview pull-quotes | calm |
| `faq.html` | 18s | FAQ replies to a comment, myth vs fact | pop |
| `announcement.html` | 18s | Launches, plus event, webinar, and live-stream promos | house |
| `team.html` | 18s | Meet the team, the people side of a company profile | acoustic |
| `narrated.html` | per script | A voiceover over one background per line, with captions synced to the voice: explainers, tips, text-led brand stories (built by `compose.js`) | the identity, energy −1 |

The skill swaps each template's default sound for your sonic identity.

### Templates for everyday posts

Most of a feed isn't ads. It's the memeable, comment-driven posts in
between: POVs, tier lists, text-message skits, storytimes. There are 22
templates for the formats that have lasted, each 10–18 seconds, written in
TikTok's own caption style (TikTok Sans, boxed captions, stickers, and
stamps):

| Group | Templates |
|---|---|
| Meme captions | `pov`, `nobody-me` (nobody: / me:), `expectation-reality`, `tell-me-without`, `makes-sense` (things that just make sense), `starter-pack` |
| Comment bait | `tier-list`, `this-or-that`, `hot-take` (with a poll), `flags` (green / red), `quiz` (guess it in 3 seconds), `rating` |
| UI skits | `text-chat`, `notifications` (a lock screen filling up), `post-card` (likes and replies), `loading` (a stalled bar and an error) |
| Story & everyday | `storytime` (word-by-word captions), `countdown` (top 5), `day-in-life`, `reveal` (wait for it), `before-after` (a wipe), `slideshow` (also a photo carousel) |

[`references/fyp-formats.md`](../references/fyp-formats.md) covers each one:
why it gets engagement, its beats, the sound, a line of copy at a playful
and a professional tone, and when not to use it. It also covers planning a
week of them: about 70% evergreen formats, 20% trends, and 10%
experiments, with no format repeated within a week. `content-calendar`
follows that rotation. The copy follows your brand voice: lowercase,
slang, and emoji only if `brand-voice.md` allows them.

Skits are always fiction: generic roles ("client", "a friend") with emoji
avatars, never a real person's name, post, or messages, never a real
app's look, and never a reply praising the product. There are no
copyrighted meme images, and the jokes are about situations and habits,
never about groups of people. Trending sounds are added in the app when
you post.
Types that need real footage (behind the scenes, vlogs, UGC, on-camera
testimonials) get a phone shot list and edit notes instead; the renderer
doesn't fake real people or events. The testimonial and team templates
ship with bracketed placeholders, which the skill replaces only with real,
permissioned material from you.

A comment at the top of `promo.html` documents how a page works: CSS
animations timed with `animation-delay` (the renderer seeks every one
frame by frame, so output is frame-exact on any machine), the background
slots, the music settings on `<body>`, and `data-sfx` cues. The templates
are built from one shared base by `templates/build.py` (the everyday ones
are defined in `templates/fyp.py`); edit those and run `python3 build.py`
rather than hand-editing 29 copies.

The skill saves its pages and renders under `state/videos/`, with media in
`state/videos/assets/`. Rendered MP4s and downloaded media are git-ignored;
`CREDITS.md` is kept.

Scaffolding for posting directly to LinkedIn, X, Meta (Facebook Page),
Reddit, Discord, Slack, Telegram, dev.to, YouTube (Shorts), Instagram
(Reels), or TikTok - no n8n/Make in between.

WARNING - read this before using it for anything real:

This talks to live, versioned platform APIs. It was written without a
connected account or working credentials for any of these platforms to
test against, so treat every request shape below as best-effort against
each platform's last publicly documented stable API, not a verified
integration. Before relying on it:

  - Confirm you actually have the right kind of API access first. Each
    platform gates posting behind its own developer-app review, X
    additionally requires a paid API tier for write access, and Reddit
    closed instant self-service app registration in late 2025 in favor of
    a manual approval queue - see the "reddit" note below. Discord needs
    no app review at all - see "discord" below. Slack sits in between:
    no OAuth review from Slack itself, but many workspaces require a
    Workspace Owner/Admin to approve new apps before a webhook can even
    be created - see "slack" below, don't assume it's as simple as
    Discord. Telegram bot creation itself needs no approval either, but
    posting into a specific chat still needs that chat's own admin to add
    the bot first - see "telegram" below. dev.to's write API needs no
    approval process found in its docs at all - just an API key generated
    from your own account settings - see "devto" below; that's about
    access, though, not content - a Tag Moderator can still strip a tag
    that doesn't fit it, or a post can still be reported through the
    sitewide Code of Conduct. YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok are a
    different shape again - all three post actual video, not text, and
    each has its own access story: see "youtube", "instagram", and
    "tiktok" below - TikTok in particular forces every post from an
    unaudited app to private/self-only visibility, no matter what's
    requested.
  - Confirm the endpoint/version below is still current - check
    developers.linkedin.com, developer.x.com, developers.facebook.com,
    Reddit's own API docs, Discord's own API docs, Slack's own API docs,
    core.telegram.org/bots/api, developers.forem.com/api (dev.to's own
    docs), developers.google.com/youtube/v3 (YouTube), and
    developers.tiktok.com/docs/en/content-posting-api-get-started (TikTok)
    directly, since these APIs change and this script cannot check for
    you.
  - Run with --dry-run and compare the printed request against that
    platform's current docs before ever passing --confirmed.
  - Do one manual --confirmed test post yourself before wiring this into
    anything scheduled or unattended.
  - For Reddit specifically: a 2xx response here only means the API
    accepted the submission - a subreddit's AutoModerator can still remove
    it silently seconds later for violating that subreddit's own rules
    (missing flair, self-promo policy, karma/age minimums, banned
    domains). Run the `community-post-generator` skill against the target
    subreddit first and resolve everything it flags before sending.
  - For Discord and Slack specifically, and for a *private* Telegram
    group/channel: `community-post-generator` can't independently verify
    that target's rules the way it can for Reddit/Product Hunt/Hacker
    News/Indie Hackers, since most private servers, workspaces, and
    groups have no public page to check at all - it works from whatever
    rules you (as an actual member) supply it. Confirm that's still
    current yourself before sending, same as you would before posting by
    hand. A *public* Telegram channel/group is the exception - see
    "telegram" below.
  - For dev.to specifically: `community-post-generator`'s research could
    not directly confirm the Code of Conduct's specific self-promotion/
    spam wording (dev.to's own domain was unreachable during that
    research). The #showdev tag and the Organizations feature both
    suggest self-promotion is structurally welcome, but that's not the
    same as a confirmed rule - a 2xx response here just means the API
    accepted the article, not that a Tag Moderator won't strip a tag that
    doesn't fit it afterward. See "devto" below.
  - For YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok specifically: run the
    `short-form-video` skill first for the actual script/caption/hashtag
    content and its best-time-to-post guidance - this script only sends
    what you give it, it doesn't draft anything. A 2xx from TikTok's init
    call or a successful Instagram container creation is not the same
    thing as "the video is live" - both process the video after this
    script's request returns (see their notes below for what to check).

Text-only for the first eight platforms. None of their media-attachment
flows are implemented here beyond that (a plain Facebook Page post via
--platform meta is text-only; Instagram has no text-only post endpoint at
all, which is why it isn't reachable via --platform meta - see
"instagram" below for the separate video flow that does exist).

YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok are video-native - see their notes below
for how each one actually receives the video (a local file YouTube pulls
the bytes from directly via a resumable upload, vs. a public URL YouTube,
Instagram, and TikTok fetch from). There is no hashtag field for
Instagram or TikTok; include hashtags directly in the caption text the
same way you'd type them in the app. YouTube's --tags is its actual
video-tags metadata (search keywords), not hashtags - put any #Shorts-
style hashtags in the description text instead.

Same safety pattern as publish_webhook.py: refuses to send unless you
pass --dry-run or --confirmed explicitly, and never sends without one.
--dry-run never makes a network call, even for the multi-step flows below
(YouTube's upload, Instagram's container-then-publish, and to a lesser
extent Reddit/Telegram/dev.to's validation) - where a later step depends
on an earlier step's real response, the preview says so explicitly rather
than faking one.

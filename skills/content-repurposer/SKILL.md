# Multi-Platform Content Repurposer

## Purpose

Take one piece of source content — a research brief, article, blog post,
or raw notes — and reformat it into three channel-native outputs in a
single pass: a LinkedIn post, a Twitter/X thread, and a newsletter blurb.
All three stay factually identical to the source and consistent with the
shared brand voice; only the format changes per channel.

## Step-by-step process

1. **Check onboarding status.** Read
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brand-voice.md`. If it doesn't exist,
   or its first line is `<!-- MARKETING-SKILL:UNCONFIGURED -->`, pause and
   ask the user this plugin's 3 setup questions (priority task; target
   audience + tone; default output format — same as
   `/marketing-skill:marketing-setup`) before continuing, then save the
   answers into that file and flip the marker to `CONFIGURED` with today's
   date. Otherwise, read it for tone, audience, banned words, and
   formatting constraints to apply below.

2. **Confirm scope.**
   - What's the source? Pasted text, a file, a URL, the output of another
     skill (e.g. a `competitor-research` brief), or something in the
     current project (e.g. "our new feature," "our latest changelog
     entry")? If it's the latter and no text was actually pasted or
     linked, use the project-content search below before asking the user
     to paste it themselves.
   - Which formats are wanted — default to all three (LinkedIn, Twitter/X
     thread, newsletter blurb) unless the user asks for only one.
   - Is there a CTA or link that should appear in every format?

3. **Finding project content (when needed).** If the user refers to "our
   product," "our feature," "our changelog," "our docs," etc. without
   pasting or linking the actual content, look for it in the current
   project before asking them to paste it:
   - Use Glob to check for `README*`, `CHANGELOG*`, and `docs/**/*.md` at
     the project root, then Read whichever file(s) look most relevant to
     what the user mentioned.
   - Also check `package.json` or `pyproject.toml` for the product's
     name/description if identity/positioning is needed.
   - Only look at documentation-oriented files this way — don't scan
     arbitrary source code for marketing content.
   - If nothing relevant turns up, say so and ask the user to paste or
     point at the right content instead of guessing.

4. **Extract the core material.** Identify the source's central thesis and
   any facts, stats, or quotes worth carrying forward. Carry these forward
   exactly — never invent a claim, statistic, or quote that isn't in the
   source.

5. **Draft each requested format** using the exact structures in "Output
   structure" below, applying the brand voice, audience, and banned-words
   list from `references/brand-voice.md`.

6. **Self-check before finalizing**: scan all drafts against the
   banned-words list and formatting constraints, and confirm the CTA/link
   (if any) is present and identical across formats.

## When to use this skill

Trigger on requests like:
- "Repurpose this for social media"
- "Turn this into a LinkedIn post / Twitter thread / newsletter"
- "Adapt this [article/brief/research] for multiple channels"

## Output structure (required)

Use this exact section order, as Markdown `##` headings, for whichever
formats were requested:

### LinkedIn Post
- First line is the hook — must work standalone in a feed preview.
- Short paragraphs or single lines separated by blank lines (no dense
  blocks).
- One idea per paragraph.
- A soft CTA near the end (a question, an invitation to comment, or a
  link if one was given).
- 3–5 relevant hashtags on the final line, no more.

### Twitter/X Thread
- Numbered tweets (`1/`, `2/`, `3/`, …).
- The first tweet must stand alone as a hook — assume it's the only one
  some readers see.
- Each tweet under 280 characters.
- Final tweet carries the CTA/link.

### Newsletter Blurb
- A suggested subject line.
- A 1–2 sentence intro.
- 3–5 bullet takeaways.
- One CTA link at the end.

## Formatting rules

- Never introduce a fact, number, or quote absent from the source.
- Keep the CTA/link identical across every format produced, if one was
  given.
- Apply `references/brand-voice.md`: tone, audience framing, and the
  banned-words list all carry over into every format.
- No format should just be a truncated copy of another — each must be
  restructured for how that platform is actually read.

## Example output

## LinkedIn Post
Most teams lose an afternoon every month just exporting reports by hand.

We just shipped one-click export: pick a report, pick a format, done.
No templates to rebuild, no copy-pasting between tools.

It's live for all customers today — no setup required.

What's still eating your afternoons? Curious what to automate next.

## Newsletter Blurb
**Subject line:** One click. No more manual exports.

Manual reporting exports have quietly cost teams hours every month — so
we removed the manual part.

- One-click export, live today for all customers
- Supports every report type, no template rebuilding
- Zero setup — nothing to turn on
